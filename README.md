# StrandLifeSciences

This project, encoded in R, was a part of my internship with the genomics/bioinformatics company Strand Life Sciences. I developed and evaluated a machine learning algorithm that--with 91% success--predicted colon, esophageal, liver, lung, and stomach cancer based on \
the DNA methylation fragment of  524 target genomic regions. Model input was the plasma samples of 828 patients from the Taizhou Medical Center. A presentation detailing every aspect of the code is linked in this GitHub project.
I also created an FDR (False discovery rate) corrected t-test before inputting samples into the model.
